<h2>The Era of Type</h2>
<p>
Writing is as old as time.  It conveys knowledge and challenges the most heinous dictators.  <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> described a dystopian future where books were burnt to prevent the viral spread of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Type is the physical manifestation of knowledge.  Type covers every surface, instructing us to stay behind the yellow line.  Telling us the total at the grocery store.  Informing us of our dining choices this evening.  Until now type was designed by type designers.
</p>
<h2>On the Origin of Specimens </h2>
<p>
Natural Selection, originally proposed by Charles Darwin, simply states that the most fit survive and reproduce.  Applying this idea to type design takes it in a new direction.  When ever you get a letter or number correct you increase its fitness and increase the likelihood that it will survive and reproduce.
