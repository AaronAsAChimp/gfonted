To install gfonted, you need to create a directory "lib":
	mkdir lib
and two subfolders:
	mkdir lib/facebook
	mkdir lib/jQuery
	
You will need jquery-1.3.2.min.js and put it in the jQuery folder.
	Available at http://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/downloads/detail?name=jquery-1.3.2.min.js

You will also need the Facebook PHP Client Library and put the contents
of the "php" folder and put it in the facebook folder.
	Available at http://svn.facebook.com/svnroot/platform/clients/packages/facebook-platform.tar.gz

Next, copy config.sample.php to config.php:
	cp config.sample.php config.php
	
and update it with the database information.

db.sql contains the queries to create all the tables.

Finally, populate the database using the form on new_glyph.php.
